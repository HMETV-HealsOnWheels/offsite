## GUI (Control Interface)

The GUI used to send TCP commands to the onboard server is located in the [Offsite Repository](https://github.com/HMETV-Fall2024/HealsOnWheels-Offsite) under the `/gui` folder. It runs on a laptop and provides a simple interface to send movement commands and predefined paths.
